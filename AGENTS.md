## Commit Workflow

When asked to "commit", perform the following steps:

1.  Check the git status.
2.  Create a new branch. 
3.  Stage the changes.
4.  Create a commit with a descriptive message.

## Conventional Commits

Use semantic conventional commit prefixes in the format `type(scope): <message>`. Examples:

- `chore(<what>):` for maintenance / refactors / non‑feature tweaks
- `feat(<what>):` for new user‑visible functionality
- `fix(<what>):` for bug fixes or correcting broken behavior
- `docs(<what>):` for documentation-only edits
- `perf(<what>):` for performance improvements
- `style(<what>):` for purely stylistic changes (whitespace, formatting) with no logic impact
- `refactor(<what>):` for structural changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test(<what>):` for test related changes
