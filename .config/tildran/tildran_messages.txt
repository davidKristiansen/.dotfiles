A programmer is someone who solves a problem you didn’t know you had in a way
you don’t understand.
------
I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.
— Douglas Adams
------
To understand recursion, you must first understand recursion.
------
Code never lies. Comments sometimes do.
------
Software is like entropy: hard to grasp, easy to spread.
------
A C program is like a fast dance on a newly waxed floor by people carrying
razor blades.
------
Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning.
------
In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. In practice,
there is.
------
Programming is like writing a book... except if you miss a single comma,
the whole thing makes no sense.
------
I would love to change the world, but they won’t give me the source code.
------
"Hello, World" is the most dangerous program. Once it works, you’re hooked.
------
I don’t always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production.
------
One man’s crappy software is another man’s full-time job.
------
Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct,
not tried it.
— Donald Knuth
------
Programming is the art of algorithm design and the craft of debugging errant
thoughts.
------
Software and cathedrals are much the same — first we build them,
then we pray.
------
Fix the cause, not the symptom.
------
To iterate is human, to recurse divine.
------
Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.
— Austin Freeman
------
Good code is its own best documentation.
------
The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off
by a bit.
------
Real programmers don’t document. If it was hard to write, it should be hard
to understand.
------
Documentation is like sex: when it is good, it is very, very good; and when
it is bad, it is better than nothing.
------
Debugging: Being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the
murderer.
------
When in doubt, use brute force.
— Ken Thompson
------
There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.
------
Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
------
If debugging is the process of removing bugs, then programming must be the
process of putting them in.
------
If it works, don’t fix it.
------
Programmers are tools for converting caffeine into code.
------
"Knock, knock."
"Who’s there?"
...long pause...
"Java."
------
99 bugs in the code, 99 bugs in the code,
Take one down, patch it around,
127 bugs in the code.
------
A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good.
------
There’s no place like 127.0.0.1
------
I don’t have bugs. I have random features.
------
You know you’re a programmer when your coffee mug has more code than coffee.
------
I used to be indecisive, but now I’m not so sure.
------
The code that is the hardest to debug is the code that you know cannot possibly
be wrong.
------
Software developers like to solve problems. If there are no problems
handily available, they will create their own problems.
------
If comments are written well, they explain why, not what.
------
A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it.
------
Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling
down the highway.
------
A program is never less than 90% complete and never more than 95% complete.
------
The only valid measurement of code quality: WTFs/minute.
------
“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a
violent psychopath who knows where you live.”
— John Woods
------
There is no Ctrl-Z in life.
------
First rule of programming: if it works, don’t touch it.
------
If it compiles, ship it.
------
Computers are fast. Programmers keep it slow.
------
I see dead code.
------
A language that doesn’t affect the way you think about programming is
not worth knowing.
— Alan Perlis
------
One man’s feature is another man’s bug.
------
Make it work, make it right, make it fast.
— Kent Beck
------
A truly great software developer delivers working code and takes
a nap afterward.
------
A commit a day keeps the merge conflicts away.
------
When your hammer is C++, everything starts looking like a thumb.
------
It’s not a bug – it’s an undocumented feature.
------
A meeting is an event where minutes are taken and hours are wasted.
------
The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking
state to the working state.
------
The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer
is doing until it’s too late.
— Seymour Cray
------
Never trust a computer you can’t throw out a window.
— Steve Wozniak
------
Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.
— Pablo Picasso
------
The perfect project plan is possible if one first documents a list
of all the unknowns.
------
The sooner you start to code, the longer the program will take.
------
There are two ways of constructing a software design: one way is to make
it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way
is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
— Tony Hoare
------
“null” is not zero, not empty, not even a value. It is the Voldemort of
programming: He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Used.
------
A program is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it.
— E. W. Dijkstra
------
Don’t comment bad code—rewrite it.
— Brian Kernighan
------
If the code and the comments disagree, both are probably wrong.
------
Programmers don’t burn out on hard work. They burn out on change-without-notice,
lack of clarity, and management politics.
------
To understand what recursion is, you must first understand recursion.
------
Python is executable pseudocode. Perl is executable line noise.
------
The best thing since sliced bread is still bread.
------
Programming without an overall architecture or design in mind is like
exploring a cave with only a flashlight.
------
Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft
building progress by weight.
— Bill Gates
------
I’ve finally learned what “upward compatible” means. It means we get to keep all
our old mistakes.
------
No matter how slick your demo is in rehearsal, when you do it in front of
a live audience, the probability of a crash is directly proportional
to the number of people watching, squared.
------
Backup regularly. Your data is one `rm -rf` away from digital oblivion.
------
A good programmer is someone who always looks both ways before crossing
a one-way street.
------
Debugging is like being blindfolded in a maze, with the walls made of rubber,
and the floor constantly shifting.
------
Fast. Good. Cheap. Pick two.
------
Good programmers write code. Great programmers delete code.
------
The best way to get a project done faster is to start sooner.
— Jim Highsmith
------
Why do we never have time to do it right, but always have time to do it over?
------
If you automate a mess, you get an automated mess.
------
If you think good architecture is expensive, try bad architecture.
— Brian Foote & Joseph Yoder
------
What one programmer can do in one month, two programmers can do in two months.
------
Give a programmer the solution and they'll implement it once.
Teach a programmer to reason and they'll ask for a week to refactor it.
------
Writing code is easy. Thinking is hard.
------
The most dangerous phrase in software: "We’ve always done it this way."
------
Some days you write code. Some days the code writes you.
------
Be the compiler you wish to see in the world.
------
It’s not broken. It’s creatively reinterpreting the spec.
------
Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified
to solve until they actually did it.
------
Don’t worry if it doesn’t work right. If everything did, you’d be out of a job.
------
I once changed a single line of CSS and unleashed a thousand layout horrors.
------
Programmer: A machine that turns caffeine and anxiety into stack traces.
------
On the seventh day, God refactored.
------
Commit early. Commit often. Commit something. Please.
------
A framework is a place to lose your originality in the name of conformity.
------
If your code doesn’t embarrass you in six months, it means you’re not improving.
------
Copy-pasting from Stack Overflow is the new rubber duck debugging.
------
It’s not a memory leak – it’s just a surprise feature.
------
The only valid comment is the one you didn’t need to write.
------
When in doubt, blame the compiler.
------
No tests, no trust.
------
When the build breaks and you didn’t touch anything, you definitely touched
something.
------
"Move fast and break things" was clearly coined by someone who never worked
on a medical device.
------
There’s no such thing as “done” in software — just “shipped for now.”
------
The cloud is just someone else’s computer that you trust too much.
------
I told my boss I needed more RAM. He gave me a motivational poster.
------
Legacy code: It works, but no one knows why.
------
My code doesn’t have bugs. It has “experimental behavior.”
------
Sometimes your code works not because you wrote it correctly,
but because the universe accidentally aligned just right.
------
A linter is just a really nitpicky coworker you can’t fire.
------
Who needs performance when you have caches?
(…and who needs caches when you have denial?)
------
Don't touch the production server.
Wait, what do you mean this *is* the production server?
------
The safest way to ship bug-free code is to never write any.
------
When in production, no one can hear you scream.
------
If code is poetry, then bugfixes are limericks written in blood.
------
Errors are red,
Logs are blue,
Your tests just passed,
But the bug's still with you.
------
Keep your scripts close and your backups closer.
------
SUDO MODE ACTIVATED: Proceed with godlike confidence and no rollback.
------
Python was made for humans. Perl was made for sorcerers.
------
I asked my code to be robust. It misunderstood and became rebellious.
------
You haven’t truly lived until you’ve run `:wq` in a panic.
------
A codebase is a living, breathing beast. Feed it structure or suffer.
------
A clean codebase is a sign of a dirty mind with good habits.
------
`git blame` – Because we all need a little catharsis.
------
If it ain’t broke, ship it.
If it is broke… well… ship it anyway. Let QA deal with it.
------
In a world of microservices, no one hears your scream across the API.
------
My dev environment is a shrine.
Please remove your shoes and `npm install` quietly.
------
There's no such thing as "too many logs" — until the disk fills up.
------
Clever is good. Clear is better.
------
Writing code is like writing a novel. Except the characters are semicolons,
and if you mess one up, the whole plot collapses.
------
Linux: because rebooting is for installing new kernels, not fixing bugs.
------
When you say "it’s just a simple change," a sysadmin cries somewhere.
------
There’s no such thing as a small PR. There’s only the illusion of one.
------
If you're writing your own scheduler, you're either building an OS or
in way too deep.
------
Why did the developer go broke?
Because he used up all his cache.
------

The road to hell is paved with magic constants.
------
I used to think comments were optional.
Then I saw my own code after 3 months.
------
Shell tip: If you ever need to test your faith in humanity, `find . -name "*~"` it.
------
One does not simply grep for meaning.
------
If the flag is undocumented, it’s probably important.
------
The only reason your program isn’t segfaulting is pure cosmic luck.
------
C is like a chainsaw.
Python is like a laser scalpel.
JavaScript is like an axe made of spaghetti.
------
Shell: where whitespace matters, but only when it ruins your day.
------
My printf statement works.
That means this bug is officially haunted.
------
Never underestimate the power of an off-by-one error to ruin your weekend.
------
If you're using `eval`, the script now owns you.
------
Heisenbug: Disappears the moment you look at it.
------
Programming is an exercise in managing disappointment creatively.
------
There’s no problem that can’t be solved with a quick `rm -rf /`.
Except the aftermath.
------
First you write tests.
Then the tests write you.
------
Always trust your instincts.
Unless your instincts say "just try it in production."

Just because it passed CI doesn’t mean it works.
------
Tabs vs spaces is the real religious war.
------
Your code is only safe until the intern hits `git push -f`.
------
Never trust a developer who says “this will be quick.”
------
A shell script grows in complexity until it becomes a bad Python app.
------
The most portable code is the one you never write.
------
Unit tests: the illusion of safety in a sea of chaos.
------
CI green? Good.
Deployed to prod? Better.
Monitoring on fire? Perfect.
------
Once you hit production, all bets are off.
------

So is my will to continue.
------
I gave up on commenting.
Now I just tweet bug fixes to myself.
