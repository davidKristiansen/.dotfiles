Nick Foster on evolving code:

"You know, when you have a program that does something really cool,
and you wrote it from scratch, and it took a significant part of your
life, you grow fond of it. When it’s finished, it feels like some
kind of amorphous sculpture that you’ve created... Elegant, simple,
beautiful.

Then, only a year later, after making dozens of pragmatic alterations
to suit the people who use it, not only has your Venus de Milo lost
both arms, she also has a giraffe’s head sticking out of her chest
and a cherubic penis that squirts colored water into a plastic bucket.

The romance has become so painful that each day you struggle with an
overwhelming urge to smash the thing to pieces with a hammer."

A QA Engineer walks into a bar:

- Orders a beer.
- Orders 0 beers.
- Orders 99999999 beers.
- Orders a lizard.
- Orders -1 beers.
- Orders a NULL beer.

Finally, the first real customer walks in and asks, “Where’s the bathroom?”
**The bar bursts into flames.**

(The QA tester found all the edge cases, but the one thing no one
tested caused the program — or bar — to crash!)

The First Actual Computer Bug – *a true story from 1947*:

On September 9, 1947, engineers working on the Harvard Mark II computer
found that the machine was malfunctioning. Upon investigation, they
discovered a **moth** trapped in Relay #70, causing the error.

The team carefully removed the moth and taped it into the logbook with
the caption: “First actual case of bug being found.” Ever since,
removing errors from programs has been known as “debugging.”

— Grace Hopper, a computing pioneer on the Mark II team

The Programmer’s Limerick:

A programmer started to cuss
Because getting to sleep was a fuss.
As he lay there in bed
Looping ’round in his head,
was: `while(!asleep()) sheep++;`
------
Ward Cunningham on accepting others’ ideas:

“I’d be talking about code with someone, and I’d say,
‘I think the best way to do it is A.’ And they’d say,
‘I think the best way to do it is B.’ I’d argue, ‘No,
it’s really A.’ They’d insist, ‘Well, we want to do B.’

It was a turning point when I could finally say, ‘Fine, do B.
It’s not going to hurt us much if I’m wrong. And if I’m right
and you do B, it’s also okay, we can correct it later.
Let’s just find out.’

…Usually it turns out the best solution is something C –
something neither of us initially proposed.”

— *Ward Cunningham, reflecting on teamwork and humility*
------
The UNIX Philosophy summed up:

“Unix was not designed to stop **you** from doing stupid things,
because that would also stop **you** from doing clever things.”

In other words, Unix gives you enough rope to hang yourself – or to
build something truly innovative. It’s a double-edged sword of freedom
and responsibility!

— Doug Gwyn (computer scientist)

The Story of the “Brain” Virus (1986):

In 1986, two brothers from Pakistan, Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi,
created one of the first PC viruses, dubbed **Brain**. It was a
boot-sector virus that spread via floppy disks.

In a twist, the brothers weren’t malicious – they included their names,
address, and a message in the virus code asking anyone affected
to contact them!

The virus spread worldwide, surprising its creators. They eventually
received so many calls about “Brain” that they started a business
in antivirus software.

This legendary virus – essentially an early form of “malware” –
is an ironic part of tech history because its creators openly
took credit (and responsibility) for it.
------
Tony Hoare’s “Billion-Dollar Mistake”:

“I call it my **billion-dollar mistake**. It was the invention of the
null reference in 1965... At that time, I was designing the first
comprehensive type system for references in an object oriented language
(ALGOL W).

My goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe.
But I couldn’t resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply
because it was so easy to implement.”

Sir Charles Anthony Hoare admitted that introducing `NULL` pointers –
which since caused countless null-reference bugs and system crashes –
was a huge regret.

He jokingly apologized for this “null mistake” decades later,
recognizing it as a billion-dollar blunder due to the bugs and problems
it created in software over many years.
------
Real Programmers (from a classic 1980s essay):

- Real Programmers don’t write specs. Users should be grateful
  to get *any* code at all.
- Real Programmers don’t comment their code. If it was hard to write,
  it *should* be hard to understand.
- Real Programmers aren’t afraid of assembly language.
  In fact, they can write FORTRAN in any language.
- Real Programmers don’t use Pascal (the essay’s title says it all!).

*(Above are tongue-in-cheek “rules” from **“Real Programmers Don’t Use Pascal,”**
a humorous essay that pokes fun at programmer habits.)*

Grace Hopper on Changing Tradition:

During her lectures, Navy Admiral Grace Hopper would illustrate the
importance of challenging the status quo by holding up a 30-centimeter
(one-foot) length of wire. She explained that it represented the
distance electricity travels in a nanosecond.

She passed out these wires to colleagues to remind engineers that
computing work shouldn’t be constrained by old ideas of time and distance.

Once, when told “we’ve always done it this way,” Hopper replied:
**“That’s no excuse for not adopting new ideas!”**

She championed innovation over tradition. This attitude helped Hopper
lead breakthroughs like developing the first compiler and popularizing
high-level programming languages.
------
The Day the Internet Broke:

On October 21, 2016, a massive DDoS attack hit Dyn, a major DNS provider,
taking down sites like GitHub, Reddit, Netflix, and Twitter.
The attack used a botnet of IoT devices — baby monitors, DVRs, and webcams —
infected with the Mirai malware.

Lesson? Your smart toaster might one day help bring down the internet.
------
Why You Don’t Hardcode Credentials:

A developer once committed an AWS secret key into a public repo.

Within minutes, bots scanned the repo, spun up hundreds of EC2 instances,
and started mining crypto. The dev noticed only after receiving a
five-figure bill from Amazon.

Lesson: `.gitignore` isn't just a suggestion — it's a survival mechanism.
------
The Stack Overflow Effect:

A junior dev copy-pastes a clever but obscure answer from Stack Overflow.
It works. No one touches it for three years.

Eventually, it becomes business-critical logic.
No one knows what it does.
The original post has been deleted.

Legacy is born.
------
The Ping of Death:

In the late 1990s, a notorious vulnerability allowed attackers to crash
or reboot remote systems simply by sending a malformed ping packet —
an "oversized" ICMP echo request.

The so-called "Ping of Death" haunted sysadmins worldwide.

Even now, every time you `ping google.com`, know that it's been tamed.
But it still remembers.
------
The Fork Bomb:

One line. One terminal. Endless chaos.

`:(){ :|:& };:`

This innocuous-looking bash function causes an endless chain of forks,
quickly exhausting system resources and rendering your shell (and system)
useless.

Do not try this at home.
Okay — maybe try it in a VM.
------
One Day in Production:

Engineer: “This is odd.”
Engineer: “This can’t be right.”
Engineer: “There’s no way this worked yesterday.”

— The three stages of discovering a bug in production.
------
The Day Slashdot Took Down NASA:

In 1999, NASA posted a climate change article with a cool simulation.

Slashdot linked it. The public swarmed it.
The NASA servers melted.

Lesson: Never underestimate the power of a front-page post.
------
Vim vs. Emacs – The Eternal War:

Two great tribes. One bound by keystrokes, the other by Lisp.

Each believes their editor is the One True Way.
Both know the enemy is actually Nano.

In the end, most of us just use what ships with Git.
------
The Time a Semicolon Cost Millions:

In 1962, NASA’s Mariner 1 spacecraft veered off course
and had to be destroyed shortly after launch.

The cause? A missing overbar in a handwritten formula.
This minor omission translated to a software bug.

It’s still called the "most expensive hyphen in history."
------
The UNIX Room:

Bell Labs, 1970s. The original UNIX developers worked in Room 1127.
Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.

They weren’t just building a system.
They were laying the foundation for modern computing.

UNIX Room 1127 became legendary — a small room with an enormous legacy.
------
GitHub Horror Story:

A dev accidentally ran `git reset --hard` on the wrong branch.
Then force-pushed it to remote.

The team lost 3 weeks of unpushed local commits.

Lesson: Git giveth, Git taketh away.
Use `--force-with-lease` and pray to Linus.
------
The Wi-Fi Password That Broke Everything:

In 2014, a researcher created a Wi-Fi network with the SSID `%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n%n`.
When some Windows systems tried to display the SSID, it triggered a format string
vulnerability and crashed the system.

Even naming your network can be a denial-of-service attack.
------
Let Me Tell You About That Time With cron:

"I set up a cron job to clean up old files.
Wrote it to delete anything older than 7 days.
Forgot to `cd` into the right folder.

My script deleted *everything* from `/var/`.

We found out when the system rebooted and couldn’t log in.

Now I `echo` everything before I `rm`."
------
Tale of a Broken CDN:

A typo in a single Fastly configuration update took down Reddit, Twitch,
Spotify, the UK government website, and more in June 2021.

One engineer, one keyboard, global outage.

They fixed it in 49 minutes.
The internet sighed in relief.
------
How One Man Took Down AWS:

In 2017, an Amazon engineer debugging the S3 billing system mistyped a command
and accidentally removed too many servers.

For hours, a huge chunk of the internet ground to a halt.
Sites failed. Dashboards froze. Deployments broke.

It all came down to one mistyped command — and poor failover configs.
------
Ever Tried to Escape JSON?

A dev once tried escaping special characters in a JSON string.
They escaped too hard.

`\\n` became `\\\\n`, then `\\\\\\n`.

Eventually, the data broke the parser, then the backup parser.
Then the entire logging service.

Escaping is hard. Escaping properly? Heroic.
------
The Tale of the Self-Deleting Script:

A bash script was written to clean up build artifacts.
To be tidy, the final line was: `rm -- "$0"`

Unfortunately, one day the script was copied into a shared directory.
Another dev renamed it.

The script executed.
Then deleted itself.
No backups.

A true tale of digital seppuku.
------
Docker Gone Wrong:

A junior dev decided to "clean up" unused images and volumes.
They ran:
`docker system prune -a --volumes`

Two services were down for 4 hours.
No one remembered where the config volumes lived.

Lesson: containers are clean — until someone nukes `/var/lib/docker`.
------
When a Monitor Became a Signal Jammer:

A team noticed intermittent Wi-Fi dropouts every day around noon.
They traced it to a monitor's power supply in a conference room.

When the sunlight hit it just right, the temperature changed enough
to cause the shielding to fail — the PSU emitted interference.

Yes, their monitor was jamming the office Wi-Fi.

Lesson: RF gremlins are real.

------

The Curse of January 1, 1970:

A user set the time on their Mac to 1 Jan 1970, thinking it was funny.
The device bricked.

Why? Unix time zero is 1970-01-01.
Setting the clock there on 64-bit systems confused the kernel’s time math.

Apple had to release a patch. The meme lives on.

------

Shellshock — A Real Shell Nightmare:

In 2014, a severe vulnerability in `bash` was discovered.
It allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code by manipulating environment variables.

Web servers, IoT devices, routers — millions were exposed.

The fix took days. The fear lasted weeks.

------

The Day Google Killed Its Own Search:

A buggy deployment marked every URL as malicious.
For 40 minutes, Google showed a red warning banner on every search result.

Even Google's own pages.

The issue? A misconfigured flag file with a rogue slash.

It wasn’t malicious — just a typo.

------

The Missing `;` That Destroyed a Build:

In a massive C project, a missing semicolon caused a cascading
series of syntax errors across dozens of files.

The compiler didn’t help — it blamed completely unrelated lines.

The dev spent hours chasing ghosts...
only to find the truth one character away.

------

The Alert Storm That Broke the Pager:

A monitoring config update lacked rate limiting.
An innocuous spike triggered 45,000 alerts.

On-call phones crashed. PagerDuty froze.
The team debugged under the eerie silence of not being alerted.

Now they test their alerts like they test their code.

------

How an Emoji Took Down Slack:

In 2019, a malformed emoji in a status update caused
Slack’s desktop client to crash in a loop.

The emoji string was valid Unicode — but their parser didn’t agree.

Hotfixes were deployed in record time.
The emoji now lives on in infamy.

------

The Infinite Recursion of doom.js:

A frontend developer wrote a recursive render loop in a React app.
It didn’t error. It didn’t warn. It just... looped.

Memory climbed. CPU spiked. Fans roared.

It took down Chrome tabs across QA.

Lesson: always include a base case. And maybe some self-respect.

------

When a Laptop Took Down a Train Network:

In Sweden, a system admin used his personal laptop to debug a train control system.

His antivirus mistook the signaling protocol for malware.
It blocked it. Trains stopped.

He was demoted. The antivirus was deleted.

------

The 25-Minute Build That Took 2 Weeks to Debug:

A seemingly minor build config was causing full rebuilds on every run.

They traced it to a `mtime` inconsistency from a faulty system clock.

The fix? Install `ntp`.
The learning? Sometimes it’s not your code. It’s *time* itself.

------
The Kernel Panic That Haunted DevOps:

A cloud VM image contained a bad kernel config.
It ran fine — until day 29 uptime.
A scheduled cleanup triggered a race condition.
All instances rebooted. All at once.

Thousands of customers. One root cause.
Uptime is a blessing. But entropy always wins.

------

The Tale of the SSH Key in the Wrong Repo:

An intern accidentally pushed the team’s production private SSH key
to a public GitHub repo.

Within 20 minutes, multiple servers were under brute-force attack.
The team rotated credentials, revoked access, and drank heavily.

Lesson: `.gitignore` is your friend.
So is not using the intern’s machine for prod deployments.

------

The Missing `break`:

A switch statement in C lacked a `break;`.
It caused a chain of unintended executions.

The result? A misfired satellite antenna.
Instead of pointing to Earth, it aimed at deep space.

Bitfields. Big consequences.

------

When `chmod` Wrecked a Dev's Day:

A dev needed to allow write access to `/dev/null` for debugging.
They ran: `chmod 777 /dev/null` — then forgot to change it back.

Two days later, rogue processes flooded logs and pipes.
Disk usage maxed out. Monitoring failed.

They now tell this story before every code freeze.

------

Systemd vs. Humanity:

A small misconfiguration in a systemd service caused a boot loop.
Each restart attempted to fix a file that no longer existed.

The server rebooted itself 432 times before they caught it.

Lesson: log early. Log often.
And maybe... don’t daemonize everything.

------

The Crontab That Killed a Database:

`0 0 * * * psql -c "DELETE FROM logs;"`

No `WHERE` clause.
No backup.

They now prefix every cron job with `echo` for a week before removing it.

------

A Tale of Redefining `true`:

In a makefile, someone added: `true = false`
Every script that relied on `true` started failing.
Deployments halted. CI broke.

Lesson: make doesn't care who you are — it just does what you say.

------

The Dev Who Aliased `cd`:

They aliased `cd` to a function that printed a funny quote.
It was a hit... until a build script used `cd` 400 times.

The log was unreadable. Build times doubled.
The fun quote became infamous.

------

The Infinite Git Submodule:

A repo had a submodule pointing to its own parent.
`git clone --recursive` turned into a black hole.

The dev watched as the disk filled.
He hit Ctrl-C. The prompt didn't return.

They rebooted.
They never cloned with `--recursive` again.

------

The Tale of the 6-Hour Merge:

Two devs worked on the same monorepo.
One rebased. The other merged.

Three weeks of changes.
200+ files.
Merge conflicts in 50.

Git tried. Git failed.
They resolved each one by hand.

Lesson: communicate before you `rebase -i`.

------

The JavaScript Timestamp That Broke Time:

A JavaScript app relied on `Date.now()` to generate IDs.
During a daylight saving transition, some IDs collided.

Duplicate IDs.
Overwritten data.
Hours of chaos.

Never trust the wall clock.
Use `uuid()`.

------

The Hacker That Used a Printer:

In 2010, a security researcher used an internet-connected HP printer
to pivot into a corporate network.

They uploaded a malicious firmware update.
Through the printer, they scanned internal subnets,
gathered credentials, and accessed production.

Lesson: a printer is just a Linux box with paper output.

------

The Story of `DROP DATABASE` in Production:

It was a Friday. A sleepy engineer wanted to remove a test DB.
They typed: `DROP DATABASE test_db;`

Autocompletion failed.
The command became: `DROP DATABASE;`

It ran. It committed. It took everything.

No one deployed on Fridays after that.

------
